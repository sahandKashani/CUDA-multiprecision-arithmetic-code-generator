// In the following code sample, the ptx code generated is lacking a few
// instructions in the mul_loc function if the mul_loc is in a loop. The ptx is
// perfectly correct though if the mul_loc is not in a loop, and is repeated
// iteratively by hand.

for (uint32_t i = 0; i < BENCHMARK_ITERATIONS; i++)
