Introduction to GPUs:
---------------------
A graphics processing unit, also known as a GPU, is a specialized electronic
circuit initially designed for fast memory manipulations needed to accelerate
the creation of images in a frame buffer, which are then outputted to a display
for viewing.

Nowadays, GPUs are present in almost all electronics, including, but not limited
to embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game
consoles.

Modern GPUs have highly parallel structures, making them much more effective
than general-purpose CPUs for algorithms which process large blocks of data in
parallel.

Thus, GPUs have become very efficient at manipulating imagery, which consists
of applying an algorithm parallely to all output pixels, which explains their
abundant use in computer graphics.

Modern GPUs use most of their circuitry to perform calculations related to 3D
computer graphics.

Computational Aspects:
----------------------
GPUs were initially used to accelerate texture mapping, polygon rendering, and
geometry.

The first GPUs had a fixed rendering pipeline, and could not be used for
anything other than common geometry transformation and pixel-shading functions.

With the introduction of programmable shaders, users could write their own
shading programs to perform custom effects on the GPU with a high degree of
flexibility, since programmable shaders could manipulate vertices and textures
with many operations supported only by CPUs at the time.

For example, programmable shaders could be used to perform oversampling and
interpolation techniques to reduce aliasing, something that was not possible
earlier with the fixed rendering pipeline.

Computations performed by programmable shaders mostly involved matrix and vector
operations, for which GPUs were very well suited (processing blocks of data in
parallel).
The availability of high speed linear algebra operations made scientists start
using GPUs for non-graphical calculations.
This was achieved by GPGPU techniques
